# Road Map Visualisation Application
A Road Map Visualisation application created as part of UNSD MOOC.
The application is written in java.
The front end uses JavaFX and was provided by the UNSD MOOC team.
The backend utilised JSON feed from the GoogleMaps API to identify intersections on real life road maps, 
and find shortest paths between them using BFS, Dijsktra and A* Graph algorithms.
